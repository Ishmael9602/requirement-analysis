# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Introduction
This focuses on Requirement Analysis, a critical phase in software development where stakeholder needs are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It ensures projects stay aligned with user expectations, prevents scope creep, and enhances development efficiency.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
  Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process 
  ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform
 - Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
  Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
  Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
  Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
  Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
  Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- List and describe at least three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC.
  1. Requirement Gathering, Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
  2. Requirement, Elicitation Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
  3. Requirement Documentation, Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Analysis involves several critical steps to ensure project success. Below are the five key activities:
- Requirement Gathering â€“ Identifying stakeholder needs through surveys, interviews, and workshops.
- Requirement Elicitation â€“ Refining and clarifying requirements using brainstorming, prototyping, and feedback sessions.
- Requirement Documentation â€“ Structuring the requirements into clear artifacts like use cases and specification documents.
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling â€“ Organizing and validating requirements using techniques like flowcharts, UML diagrams, or other models.
- Requirement Validation â€“ Ensuring accuracy and feasibility through stakeholder reviews and iterative refinements.

# Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the core functionalities of the system, specifying what it should do. These are directly related to user interactions and business operations.
Examples for the Booking Management System:
- Users should be able to create, update, and cancel bookings.
- The system must send automated booking confirmation emails.
- Users should have access to real-time room availability.
Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements outline how the system performs rather than what it does. These focus on quality attributes like performance, security, and usability.
Examples for the Booking Management System:
- The system should support 500 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- Bookings must be processed within 2 seconds for optimal user experience.
- All user data must be encrypted to ensure security and privacy compliance.

# Use Case Diagrams 
A **Use Case Diagram** is a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that shows how users (actors) interact with a system. It captures the systemâ€™s functionality from a userâ€™s perspective.

### ðŸ”¹ Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- Helps identify system requirements clearly.
- Improves communication between stakeholders and developers.
- Serves as a foundation for creating system architecture and test cases.

Below is a use case diagram for the **Booking System**.

## Acceptance Criteria  

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions a feature must meet to be considered complete and functional. They ensure alignment with business needs and prevent misunderstandings during development.  

**Example: Checkout Feature Acceptance Criteria**  

- The system must allow users to select a payment method and confirm booking details.  
- A successful transaction must generate an automated booking confirmation.  
- Users should receive a detailed invoice via email upon payment completion.  
- Errors in payment processing must display a user-friendly message with retry options.
